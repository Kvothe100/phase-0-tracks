#create an empty hash
alias_name = {}
#The real name and alias name will be stored there

#user input to get the name

#split the name into two parts: a first and last name.
#Swap them

#split the letters in both names to be manipulated.
#I did some googling and found out a really cool
#string method .tr that will work really good for this
#....I think

#store the before and after name in the empty has

#use the key and value to print back the data for all of the inputs
#store it with a sort of |name, alias| block
#"#{alias} is really #{name}"
